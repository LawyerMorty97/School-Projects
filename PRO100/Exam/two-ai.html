                <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-2">First of all, there are both pros and cons with artificial intelligence. Let's start with the pros.</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-3">In the future, human beings can be replaced by intelligent machines in different areas of work. With the intelligence programmed in them, the robots can carry greater and heavier responsibilites, as well as manage themselves. In other words, robots can be programmed to do laborious tasks - jobs that takes a lot of time and effort for humans that an intelligent machine can finish in no time.</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-4">Secondly, the application of artificial intelligence is already been used in smartphones as an utility to predict what a user is going to type. Artificial intelligence can also help with correcting human errors in spelling. Other examples also include applications like Siri that makes the daily life of a human a lot easier by acting as a personal assistant.</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-5">Soon, artificial intelligence will be advanced enough to further change our daily routines. For instance, voice operated assistants will greatly help children who aren't tall enough to turn off the lights. In the near future, they will simply be able to give a voice order to a voice operated assistant and achieve the same results!</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-6">However, there are some cons of artificial intelligence.</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-7">Imagine a robots vs. humans scenario. Overdeveloped artificial intelligence can be devastating when programmed by people with an evil mindset. In other words, in the future, we may discover that someone out there with evil intentions will develop a robot that is programmed to kill.</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-8">Another disadvantage that comes with artificial intelligence is the cost of maintenance and repair. Changing requirements calls for frequent updates.</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
                    <p class="chat-message-9">The concept of caring, understanding and concern is absolutely absent for a robot that is programmed to perfom repetitive tasks for long. For instance, robots working in hospitals may be very good at whatever they are programmed to do, but they definitely lack the human touch.</p>
                  </div>
                
                 <div class="chat robot">
